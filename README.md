# Description
This repo contains a set of 5 problems 
- Lab1: Implement and test the efficiency of three sorting algorithms - Selection Sort, Merge Sort, MergeSel Sort (a combination of selection and merge).
- Lab2: Implement and test 3 different algorithms to perform large integer multiplication.
  - 1st algorithm: Multiply digit by digit, O(n^2)
  - 2nd algorithm: Divide and Conquer using Karatsuba’s algorithm, O(n ^1.585)
  - 3rd algorithm, Modified Karatsuba’s algorithm, where only recurses for multiplicand digits > 8
- Lab3: Given a random tree structure as an adjacency matrix, create the appropriate minimum spanning tree.
- Lab4: Implement a greedy algorithm to determine if a hotel with N rooms can accommodate a series of room requests.
- Lab5: Implement optimal 0-1 knapsack algorithm for lab4.
