# Description
This repo contains a set of 5 problems:
- Lab1: Implement and evaluate the efficiency of three sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and MergeSel Sort (a hybrid of selection and merge).
- Lab2: Develop and analyze three different algorithms for large integer multiplication:
  - Multiply digit by digit (O(n^2))
  - Utilize Divide and Conquer with Karatsuba’s algorithm (O(n^1.585))
  - Enhance Karatsuba’s algorithm with modifications to reduce recursion (only recurse for multiplicand digits > 8)
- Lab3: Construct the minimum spanning tree from a given random tree structure represented as an adjacency matrix.
- Lab4: Design a greedy algorithm to assess the feasibility of accommodating room requests for a hotel with N rooms.
- Lab5: Implement the optimal 0-1 knapsack algorithm to solve the problem described in Lab4.
